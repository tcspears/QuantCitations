cir,"This paper uses an intertemporal general equilibrium asset pricing model to study the term structure of interest rates. In this model, anticipations, risk aversion, investment alternatives, and preferences about the timing of consumption all play a role in determining bond prices. Many of the factors traditionally mentioned as influencing the term structure are thus included in a way which is fully consistent with maximizing behavior and rational expectations. The model leads to specific formulas for bond prices which are well suited for empirical testing."
holee,"This paper derives an arbitrage-free interest rate movements model (AR model). This model takes the complete term structure as given and derives the subsequent stochastic movement of the term structure such that the movement is arbitrage free. We then show that the AR model can be used to price interest rate contingent claims relative to the observed complete term structure of interest rates. This paper also studies the behavior and the economics of the model. Our approach can be used to price a broad range of interest rate contingent claims, including bond options and callable bonds."
hjm,"This paper presents a unifying theory for valuing contingent claims under a stochastic term structure of interest rates. The methodology, based on the equivalent martingale measure technique, takes as given an initial forward rate curve and a family of potential stochastic processes for its subsequent movements. A no arbitrage condition restricts this family of processes yielding valuation formulae for interest rate sensitive contingent claims which do not explicitly depend on the market prices of risk. Examples are provided to illustrate the key results."
vasicek,"The paper derives a general form of the term structure of interest rates. The following assumptions are made: (A.l) The instantaneous (spot) interest rate follows a diffusion process; (A.2) the price of a discount bond depends only on the spot rate over its term; and (A.3) the market is efficient. Under these assumptions, it is shown by means of an arbitrage argument that the expected rate of return on any bond in excess of the spot rate is proportional to its standard deviation. This property is then used to derive a partial differential equation for bond prices. The solution to that equation is given in the form of a stochastic integral represen- tation. An interpretation of the bond pricing formula is provided. The model is illustrated on a specific case."
bdt,"In one simple and versatile model of interest rates, all security prices and rates depend on only one factor -- the short rate. The current structure of long rates and their estimated volatilities are used to construct a tree of possible future short rates. This tree can then be used to value interest-rate-sensitive securities. For example, a two-year, zero-coupon bond has a known price at the end of the second year, no matter what short rate prevails. Its possible prices after one year can be obtained by discounting the expected two-year price by the possible short rates one year out. An iterative process is used to find the rates that will be consistent with the current market term structure. The price today is then determined by discounting the one-year price (in a binomial tree, the average of the two possible one-year prices) by the current short rate. Given a market term structure and resulting tree of short rates, the model can be used to value a bond option. First the future prices of a Treasury bond at various points in time are found. These prices are used to determine the option's value at expiration. Given the values of a call or put at expiration, their possible values before expiration can be found by the same discounting procedure used to value the bond. The model can also be used to determine option hedge ratios."
bk,"This article describes a one-factor model for bond and option pricing that is based on the short-term interest rate and that allows the target rate, mean reversion and local volatility to vary deterministically through time. For any horizon, the distribution of possible short rates is lognormal, so the rate neither falls below zero nor reflects off a barrier at zero. A model like this allows one to match the yield curve, the volatility curve and the cap curve. Surprisingly, adding to future local volatility lowers the volatility curve. A conventional binary tree with probabilities of 0.5 but variable time spacing is used to value bonds and options. When the inputs are constant, the slope of the yield curve starts out positive and ends up negative, while its curvature shifts from negative to positive. Even when mean reversion is zero, the volatility curve has a negative slope. The differential cap curve rises steeply (through the effects of volatility) and then falls steeply (through the effects of discounting and a falling forward rate used as the strike price)."
hagan_woordward,"A general procedure for creating Markovian interest rate models is presented. The models created by this procedure automatically fit within the HJM framework and fit the initial term structure exactly. Therefore they are arbitrage free. Because the models created by this procedure have only one state variable per factor, two- and even three-factor models can be computed efficiently, without resorting to Monte Carlo techniques. This computational efficiency makes calibration of the new models to market prices straightforward. Extended Hull– White, extended CIR, Black–Karasinski, Jamshidian’s Brownian path independent models, and Flesaker and Hughston’s rational lognormal models are one-state variable models which fit naturally within this theoretical framework. The ‘separable’ n-factor models of Cheyette and Li, Ritchken, and Sankarasubramanian – which require n(n + 3)/2 state variables – are degenerate members of the new class of models with n(n + 3)/2 factors. The procedure is used to create a new class of one-factor models, the ‘beta-eta models.’ These models can match the implied volatility smiles of swaptions and caplets, and thus enable one to eliminate smile error. The beta-eta models are also exactly solvable in that their transition densities can be written explicitly. For these models accurate – but not exact – formulas are presented for caplet and swaption prices, and it is indicated how these closed form expressions can be used to efficiently calibrate the models to market prices."
milterson_sandmann_sondermann,"We derive a unified model that gives closed form solutions for caps and floors written on interest rates as well as puts and calls written on zero-coupon bonds. The crucial assumption is that simple interest rates over a fixed finite period that matches the contract, which we want to price, are log-normally distributed. Moreover, this assumption is shown to be consistent with the Heath-Jarrow-Morton model for a specific choice of volatility."
andersen_1999,"This paper considers the pricing of Bermuda-style swaptions in the Libor market model (Brace et al (1997), Jamshidian (1997), Miltersen et al (1997)) and its extensions (Andersen and Andreasen (1998)). Due to its large number of state variables, application of lattice methods to this model class is generally not feasible, and we instead focus on a simple technique to incorporate early exercise features into the Monte Carlo method. Our approach involves a direct search for an early exercise boundary parametrized in intrinsic value and the values of still-alive swaptions. We compare results of the proposed algorithm against prices obtained from Markov Chain approximations and finite difference methods. The proposed algorithm is fast and robust, and produces a lower bound on Bermudan swaption prices that appears to be very tight for many realistic structures. The paper contains several numerical results against which other methods can be tested."
hull_white_1990,"This article shows that the one-state-variable interest-rate models of Vasicek (1977) and Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985b) can be extended so that they are consistent with both the current term structure of interest rates and either the current volatilities of all spot interest rates or the current volatilities of all forward interest rates. The extended Vasicek model is shown to be very tracta- ble analytically. the article compares option prices obtained using the extended Vasicek model with those obtained using a number of other models."
bgm,"A class of term structure models with volatility of lognormal type is analyzed in the general HJM framework. The corresponding market forward rates do not explode, and are positive and mean reverting. Pricing ofcapsandﬂoors isconsistent withthe Blackformulas usedin themarket. Swaptions are priced with closed formulas that reduce (with an extra assumption) to exactly the Black swaption formulas when yield and volatility are ﬂat. A two-factor version of the model is calibrated to the U.K. market price of caps and swaptions and to the historically estimated correlation between the forward rates."
jamshidian_smm,"A self-contained theory is presented for pricing and hedging LIBOR and swap derivatives by arbitrage. Appropriate payoff homogeneity and measurability conditions are identified which guarantee that a given payoff can be attained by a self-financing trading strategy. LIBOR and swap derivatives satisfy this condition, implying they can be priced and hedged with a finite number of zero-coupon bonds, even when there is no instantaneous saving bond. No- tion of locally arbitrage-free price system is introduced and equivalent criteria established. Stochastic differential equations are derived for term structures of forward libor and swap rates, and shown to have a unique positive solution when the percentage volatility function is bounded, implying existence of an arbitrage- free model with such volatility specification. The construction is explicit for the lognormal LIBOR and swap “market models”, the former following Musiela and Rutkowski (1995). Primary examples of LIBOR and swap derivatives are discussed and appropriate practical models suggested for each."
hunt_kennedy,"We introduce a general class of interest rate models in which the value of pure discount bonds can be expressed as a functional of some (low- dimensional) Markov process. At the abstract level this class includes all current models of practical importance. By specifying these models in Markov-functional form, we obtain a specification which is efficient to implement. An additional advantage of Markov-functional models is the fact that the specification of the model can be such that the forward rate distribution implied by market option prices can be fitted exactly, which makes these models particularly suited for derivatives pricing. We give examples of Markov-functional models that are fitted to market prices of caps/floors and swaptions."
cheyette,"The Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) model of interest rates provides a fully general paradigm for the specification of interest rate term structure dynamics. However, there is no way to describe the dynamics of an arbitrary HJM model by means of a finite number of state variables while maintaining exact arbitrage freedom. This makes practical application of the model difficult. This paper provides a construction of a class of arbitrage free term structure models that are Markovian in a finite number of state variables, consistent with an arbitrary initial term structure, and capable of representing almost any term structure of forward rate volatility with arbitrary accuracy (subject to standard technical conditions). Put another way, this paper shows how to approximate a large class of HJM models with an arbitrage-free Markov model to arbitrary accuracy. The approximation can be made as accurate as desired by using a sufficiently large number of state variables. In practice, accuracy at the level of statistical uncertainty for the term structure of volatility of the US Treasury market can be achieved with five state variables for the first principal component."
brennan_schwartz,This paper develops an arbitrage model of the term structure of interest rates based on the assumptions that the whole term structure at any point in time may be expressed as a function of the yields on the longest and shortest maturity default free instruments and that these two yields follow a Gauss-Wiener process. Arbitrage arguments are used to derive a partial differential equation which must be satisfied by the values of all default free bonds. The joint stochastic process for the two yields is estimated using Canadian data and the model is used to price a sample of Government of Canada bonds.
piterbarg_2003,"Callable Libor exotics is a class of single-currency interest-rate contracts that are Bermuda-style exercisable into underlying contracts consisting of fixed-rate, floating-rate and option legs. Bermuda swaptions, callable inverse floaters and callable range accruals are all examples of callable Libor exotics. It is commonly agreed that these instruments are best modeled using forward Libor models. There are many problems, both technical and conceptual, that arise when applying forward Libor models to callable Libor exotics. These problems span calibration, valuation and computation of risk sensitivities. This paper, to the best of our knowledge, is the first comprehensive overview of calibration, pricing and Greeks calculation techniques for callable Libor exotics in forward Libor models. Many technical results and practical methods presented in the paper are original. Others are adaptations, generalizations and extensions of known approaches. Among the technical contributions of this paper are the recommendations for basis functions for the Longstaff-Schwartz valuation algorithm, the extension of the pathwise differentiation method to callable Libor exotics and elegant Greeks formulas that result, novel smoothing techniques for Monte-Carlo, applica- tion of Markovian approximations and PDE methods to the problem of variance reduction, and practical algorithms for obtaining vegas in forward Libor models. In addition, strategies for calibrating forward Libor models for callable Libor exotics are discussed at length."
denson_joshi,"The Libor market model (LMM) is commonly used for pricing exotic interest rate deriv- atives. However, its popularity is limited by the fact that its high- dimensionality necessitates (quasi)-Monte Carlo simulation for pric- ing. Such simulation is often criticised because of its low convergence rate and the difficulties of pricing early-exercisable derivatives. Lattice models do not suffer from these problems, but provide less flexibility in terms of correlation structures and calibration to market data. One solution (Piterbarg, 2004) is to use a Markov functional approximation to the LMM as a control variate. Thus the part that is able to be priced on a lattice is priced quickly, while the remaining part has lower variance and thus the Monte Carlo simulation converges quickly. The key features of the con- trol variate are that it can be evaluated using both partial differ- ential equations (PDEs) and simulations, and that the simulation can be made to be highly correlated with the LMM simulation. There has been little discussion of how to carry out the fitting. In this article, we solve the problem of how to fit a Markov functional approximation to a given calibration of the LMM in such a way that the control variate varies smoothly with the calibration. One virtue of this approach is that it allows the possibility of using the control variates for vegas as well as prices and deltas."
diebold_li,"Despite powerful advances in yield curve modeling in the last 20 years, comparatively little attention has been paid to the key practical problem of forecasting the yield curve. In this paper we do so. We use neither the no-arbitrage approach nor the equilibrium approach. Instead, we use variations on the Nelson–Siegel exponential components framework to model the entire yield curve, period-by-period, as a three-dimensional parameter evolving dynamically. We show that the three time-varying parameters may be interpreted as factors corresponding to level, slope and curvature, and that they may be estimated with high efficiency. We propose and estimate autoregressive models for the factors, and we show that our models are consistent with a variety of stylized facts regarding the yield curve. We use our models to produce term-structure forecasts at both short and long horizons, with encouraging results. In particular, our forecasts appear much more accurate at long horizons than various standard benchmark forecasts."
nelson_siegel,"This paper introduces a parametrically parsimonious model for yield curves that has the ability to represent the shapes generally associated with yield curves: monotonic, humped, and S-shaped. We find that the model explains 96% of the variation in bill yields across maturities during the period 1981-83. The movement of the parameters through time reflects and confirms a changein Federal Reserve monetary policy in late 1982. The ability of the fitted curves to predict the price of the long-term Treasury bond with a correlation of .96 suggests that the model captures important attributes of the yield/maturity relation."
fisher_nychka_zervos,"We describe a technique for fitting the term structure of interest rates using smoothing splines, which incorporate a ""roughness"" penalty. An increase in the penalty reduces the effective number of parameters. We use generalized cross validation to choose adaptively the penalty and hence the effective number of parameters. We show how our technique can be used to spline an arbitrary transformation of the discount function, using a B-spline bases. Our Monte Carlo simulations and estimation results suggest that fitting a smoothing spline to the forward rate curve using generalized cross validation produces the best results. "
svensson,"The use of forward interest rates as a monetary policy indicator is demonstrated, using Sweden 1992-1994 as an example. The forward rates are interpreted as indicating market expectations of the time- path of future interest rates, future inflation rates, and future currency depreciation rates. They separate market expectations for the short, medium and long term more easily than the standard yield curve. Forward rates are estimated with an extended and more flexible version of Nelson and Siegel's functional form."
duffie_kan,"This paper presents a consistent and arbitrage-free multifactor model of the term structure of interest rates in which yields at selected fixed maturities follow a parametric multivariate Markov diffusion process with “stochastic volatility.” The yield of any zero-coupon bond is taken to be a maturity- dependent affine combination of the selected “basis” set of yields. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the stochastic model for this affine representation. We include numerical techniques for solving the model, as wcll as numerical techniques for calculating the prices of term-structure derivative prices. The case of jump diffusions is also considered."
piazessi,"This chapter reports some recent successes in the study of affine term structure models. After explaining the importance of understanding bond yields and the need for cross-equation restrictions, the paper describes the general technique of pricing bonds in continuous time. Section 3 explains how to specify the short rate, the dynamics of the state vector, and the risk premia in an affine model. Section 4 links them to the fundamentals of an economy, and Section 5 examines some famous affine models. Section 6 explains how to estimate affine models, and Section 7 discusses the empirical performance of affine models."
dothan,"The paper presents a valuation formula for default free bonds for a certain class of tastes when the instantaneously risk-free rate of interest follows a geometric Wiener process. Properties of the resulting term structure of interest rates are studied, and an application of the analysis to the pricing of Treasury Bills is proposed."
longstaff_schwartz,The authors develop a two-factor general equilibrium model of the term structure. The factors are the short-term interest rate and the volatility of the short-term interest rate. The authors derive closed-form expressions for discount bonds and study the properties of the term structure implied by the model. The dependence of yields on volatility allows the model to capture many observed properties of the term structure. The authors also derive closed-form expressions for discount bond options. The authors use Hansen's generalized method of moments framework to test the cross-sectional restrictions imposed by the model. The tests support the two-factor model.

kim_wright,"This paper reviews a simple three-factor arbitrage-free term structure model estimated by Federal Reserve Board staff and reports results obtained from fitting this model to U.S. Treasury yields since 1990. The model ascribes a large portion of the decline in long-term yields and distant-horizon forward rates since the middle of 2004 to a fall in term premiums. A variant of the model that incorporates inflation data indicates that about two-thirds of the decline in nominal term premiums owes to a fall in real term premiums, but estimated compensation for inflation risk has diminished as well. "
cochrane_piazessi,"We study time variation in expected excess bond returns. We run regressions of one-year excess returns on initial forward rates. We find that a single factor, a single tent-shaped linear combination of forward rates, predicts excess returns on one- to five-year maturity bonds with R2 up to 0.44. The return-forecasting factor is countercyclical and forecasts stock returns. An important component of the return-forecasting factor is unrelated to the level, slope, and curvature movements described by most term structure models. We document that measurement errors do not affect our central results. "
constantinides,"A model of the nominal term structure of interest rates is developed that has a positive and stationary process for the interest rate and delivers closed-form expressions for the prices of discount bonds and European options on bonds. Unlike the one-state-variable version of the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985) model, this model--even in its one-state-variable version--allows the term premium to change sign as a function of the state and the term to maturity, and also allows for shapes of the yield curve that are observed in the U.S. data but that are disallowed in the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross model.

bradley_crane,"The bond portfolio problem is viewed as a multistage decision problem in which buy, sell, and hold decisions are made at successive (discrete) points in time. Normative models of this decision problem tend to become very large, particularly when its dynamic structure and the uncertainty of future interest rates and cash flows are incorporated in the model. In this paper we present a multiple period bond portfolio model and suggest a new approach for efficiently solving problems which are large enough to make use of as much information as portfolio managers can reasonably provide. The procedure utilizes the decomposition algorithm of mathematical programming and an efficient technique developed for solving subproblems of the overall portfolio model. The key to the procedure is the definition of subproblems which are easily solved via a simple recursive relationship."
diebold_ji_li,"We assess and apply the term-structure model introduced by Nelson and Siegel (1987) and re-interpreted by Diebold and Li (2003) as a modern three-factor model of level, slope and curvature. First, we ask whether the model is a member of the affine class, and we find that it is not. Hence the poor forecasting performance recently documented for affine term structure models in no way implies that our model will forecast poorly, which is consistent with Diebold and Li’s (2003) finding that it indeed forecasts quite well. Next, having clarified the relationship between our three-factor model and the affine class, we proceed to assess its adequacy directly, by testing whether its level, slope and curvature factors do indeed capture systematic risk. We find that they do, and that they are therefore priced. Finally, confident in the ability of our three-factor model to capture the pricing relations present in the data, we proceed to explore its efficacy in bond portfolio risk management. Traditional Macaulay duration is appropriate only in a one-factor (level) context; hence we move to a three-factor generalized duration, and we show the superior performance of hedges constructed using it."
mccullough,"It has been demonstrated, by Robichek and Niebuhr [8], that tax-induced bias can substantially alter the shape of the yield curve if it is constructed from quotations on bonds selling below par. The apparent before tax yield curve can be upward sloping at the same time that the tax-adjusted yield curve is downward sloping. Thus, the inclusion of tax effects can actually reverse qualitative conclusions concerning the direc- tion in which investors expect interest rates to move under the expectations hypothesis. Furthermore, simple before tax term structure estimation does not satisfactorily explain the market prices of low coupon bonds selling at a discount, because of the long-term capital gains tax advantage on these securities. Treating these bonds as outliers is unsatisfactory, since they constitute the bulk of observations for some maturities. The present paper modifies our technique for regression fitting the term structure of interest rates, described in an earlier paper [4], to eliminate this tax-induced bias and reconcile observations on high and low coupon bonds."
waggoner,"Cubic splines have long been used to extract the discount, yield, and forward rate curves from coupon bond data. McCulloch used regression splines to estimate the discount function, and, more recently, Fisher, Nychka, and Zervos used smoothed splines, with the roughness penalty selected by generalized cross-validation, to estimate the forward rate curve. I propose using a smoothed spline but with a roughness penalty that can vary across maturities, to estimate the forward rate curve. This method is tested against the methods of McCulloch and Fisher, Nychka, and Zervos using monthly bond data from 1970 through 1995."
bjork_christiansen,"We consider as given an arbitrage‐free interest rate model M, and a parametrized family of forward rate curves G. We study the question as to when the given family G is consistent with the dynamics of the interest rate model M, in the sense that M actually will produce forward rate curves belonging to G. We allow the interest rate model to be driven by a multidimensional Wiener process, as well as by a marked point process, and we give necessary and sufficient conditions for consistency. As test cases, we study some popular models, obtaining both positive and negative results about consistency. We also introduce a natural exponential‐polynomial family of forward rate curves, and for this family we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of consistent interest rate models with deterministic volatility functions.

anderson_andreasen,"This paper considers extensions of the Libor market model (Brace et al (1997), Jamshidian (1997), Miltersen et al (1997)) to markets with volatility skews in observable option prices. We expand the family of forward rate processes to include diffusions with non-linear forward rate dependence and discuss efficient techniques for calibration to quoted prices of caps and swaptions. Special emphasis is put on generalized CEV processes for which closed-form expressions for cap and swaption prices are derived. We also discuss modifications of the CEV process which exhibit more appealing growth and boundary characteristics. The proposed models are investigated numerically through Crank-Nicholson finite difference schemes and Monte Carlo simulations."
andreasen,We combine classical ideas of separable volatility structures in the HJM framework with the latest techniques for calibration of stochastic volatility models and create a new class of efficient multi-factor term structure models with stochastic volatility. These models have the flexibility of as the Libor market models but the speed of the short rate models.
